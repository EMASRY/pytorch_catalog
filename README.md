### PyTorch_catalog
PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:

> - Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
> - Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

This repository contains [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) catalog for [Sakku cloud platform](https://panel.sakku.cloud/catalog).
